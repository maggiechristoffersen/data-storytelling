## About
This is a webpage created for the Kode With Klossy Data Storytelling Guided Challenge. I was asked to incorporate data from the Black Wealth Data Center, thoughts and conclusions based on that data, and a scroll feature into a webpage deployed on Github Pages. This is my result.

## Sources
All sources are linked within the webpage. If there are any other questions regarding sourcing feel free to message maggiechris1104@gmail.com.

## Thank You
Special thank yous go out to Jasmine and Tara for your work creating the challenge and your help along the way, Rich and Whigham for the feedback on my research question, and Vedya for being my facilitator along the way. Thanks of course to Kode With Klossy and the Black Wealth Data Center.
